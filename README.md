# AWS Lambda TLQ (Transform, Load, Query) Data Pipeline 
### TCSS 562: Software Engineering for Cloud Computing â€“ Fall 2019 

## Objective
To goal for the TCSS562 term project is to implement a serverless cloud native application using the
AWS Lambda serverless computing platform to analyze the performance and cost implications of programming language selection.

## Research Questions
The application is implemented to help us conduct the experiement to investigate the following research questions:
- What are the implications that the programming language has on the runtime and throughput performance of the serverless application? 
- What are the cost differences between deploying Python and Java functions in AWS Lambda?

## Technology / Tools Used
- Programming Languages
-- Java 8
-- Python 3.7
- AWS S3
- AWS Lambda
- AWS CLI
- SQLite3
- Python: Boto3, Pandas
- Java: Maven
